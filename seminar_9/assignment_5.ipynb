    "# Assignment 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore embeddings and CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Using tweeter dataset ( https://www.kaggle.com/utathya/sentiment-analysis-of-imdb-reviews/data) and already existing splitting on train/test sets, develop a model for sentiment analysis.  \n",
    "Your quality metric is crossentropy (`sklearn.metrics.log_loss`, `torch.nn.CrossEntropy`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your model should be based on CNN and written in pytorch `torch.nn.Conv1d`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore 3 ways, which of them has better perfomance on test set?:\n",
    "1. Using pretrained word embeddings with frozen weights. `torch.nn.Embedding.from_pretrained(embed_matrix, frozen=True)`.\n",
    "You can download any pretrained embeddings you like.\n",
    "2. Train embeddings yourself, initializing from pretrained weights. `torch.nn.Embedding.from_pretrained(embed_matrix, frozen=False)`\n",
    "3. Train embeddings yourself with random initialization `torch.nn.init.uniform_(nn.Embeddings.weights)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with model arhitecture (as bonus):\n",
    "1. activation functions RELU, ELU, etc `torch.nn.functional.relu, torch.nn.functional.elu`  \n",
    "1. Stack layers\n",
    "1. max or average pooling (`torch.nn.functional.max_pool1d, torch.nn.functional.avg_pool1d`)\n",
    "1. Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other requirements:\n",
    "1. Your training routine should use any learning scheduler (torch.nn.optim.lr_scheduler).  \n",
    "Plot current learning rate against number of epochs, e.g. `tt.optim.Adam.param_groups[0]['lr']`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your training routine should use early stopping on validation dataset\n",
    "Use hold out validation scheme in your experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You should use torchtext for parsing \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "This assignment has no baseline. Instead, **validation curves** for explored architectures are expected.  \n",
    "Validation curve is plot of model test score against model hyperparameter value.  \n",
    "example (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_validation_curve.html) . \n",
    "Though, using `sklearn.model_selection.validation_curve` is not necessary.  \n",
